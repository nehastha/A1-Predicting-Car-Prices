# Assignment: A1-Predicting-Car-Prices

In this assignment I have used 4 features (year, engine, km_driven and mileage) to predict the selling price of cars. For Modelling I have used model such as Linear Regression, SVR, KNeighbors Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor. Dash-based frontend has been developed to provide an interactive user interface.

The dash application can be runned using:
```
python app/app.py
```
